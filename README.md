# PLS_products

This repository is the master codebase for processing raw PLS point data for subsequent use in PalEON products. The code takes as input the raw point data provided by PalEON, David Mladenoff, and other sources. Note that the 'raw point data' have already been cleaned and quality-controlled by the various sources. The code then applies additional processing to produce as near as possible a uniform database of point data across the upper Midwest (defined as Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana). The code then applies spatial statistics models to produced gridded biomass, stem density, and basal area on the 8 km PalEON grid. 

This code is the next generation of code from Simon Goring's WitnessTrees repository and from Kelly Heilman's KAH/bimodality repository.
