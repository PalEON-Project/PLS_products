there are patches in far SE MI and just N of north lobe of Big Woods where all or most points have diam recorded as 0

red blotch in middle of UP - seems legit - patch with some big trees and in some cases fairly dense; note that a few large trees can really pull up the values in a cell

there is a fairly sharp boundary in tree size in going from MI_44 to MI_45 e.g. within cell 15186 - south of boundary is big trees and north is not (and L1 abbrevs change from lower case to upper case so perhaps a surveyor issue), but then MI_43 also seems big

all cases we have of 2nd tree as water are in MN; in other places we don't have things recorded as whether each tree is water; in IN/IL if any trees then don't note as water

see various issues in PLS_products repo

3/17/18:
1-tree/no-tree issue - see "no tree/no data issue" email 12/18/14 and "treed points" email 8/15/15

could Charlie suggest an area within which we think there is one tree such that we can give low estimate of density there; should we just call it 0 density even for the taxon present?

remove: 'Water' or 'No data'
0 tree points: 'No tree' as L1_tree1
1 tree points: NA as tree2 info where L1_tree1 is not 'No tree'

note that a fair number of 1-tree points have 0 distance to first tree

should water be treed as absent or as no tree; i.e. should our biomass be conditioal on no water or average over no water; I think probably throw out water as if near water, should likely be able to find trees and get an estimate

should we be doing things like screening out line trees in the PLS_products?

3/2/18: top row of indiana seems to overlap bottom row of michigan
same for top of illinois and bottom of umw
so mi and umw seem to line up well

Jody said she would address this.

3/2/18
so mi 1.2 and umw 1.0 seem to line up well
