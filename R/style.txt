Some thoughts from Chris on coding style that he plans to use in this repository.

- try to avoid use of "." within object names; instead use "_" and lower-case for object names
- avoid hard-coding paths and use file.path and relative paths
- put constants into config file
- put setup stuff into master.R (and call individual analysis steps from there)
- use readr / dplyr and piping for dataset manipulations
